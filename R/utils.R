# Hadley: "All functions in a package should be related to a single problem
# (or a set of closely related problems). Any functions not related to that
# purpose should not be exported. For example, most of my packages have a
# utils.R file that contains many small functions that are useful for me, but
# arenâ€™t part of the core purpose of those packages. I never export these
# functions."
# These simple, internal functions do not need roxygen documentation and will
# not be user-facing.
